# CSE30124 Intro to AI Project

This is the [Final Project] of [CSE.30124.FA23] at the University of Notre Dame.

## Students

1. William Robbins (wrobbins@nd.edu)

## Training Script

The file [sentiment_analysis_train.py](sentiment_analysis_train.py) shows the code used to fine-tune the base model and has removed the login token and name of the fine
tuned model to allow for reproduction by other users.

## Demonstration

The file [introToAI_Project.ipynb](introToAI_Project.ipynb) is a colab notebook file used to show how to use my fine-tuned model and also compare it with classical
lexical-based sentiment analysis and additionally compare it to the HuggingFace model finetuned on the same data.

## Errata

I was having trouble uploading to hugging face from the command line so some changes in the training script may need to be modified to save
your model. In any case, you can save the files locally and upload them to your page through the Hugging Face website.
